This is a sticky post.

There are a few things to verify:

-  The sticky post should be distinctly recognizable in some way in
   comparison to normal posts. You can style the ``.sticky`` class if
   you are using the
   `post\_class() <http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_class>`__
   function to generate your post classes, which is a best practice.
-  They should show at the very top of the blog index page, even though
   they could be several posts back chronologically.
-  They should still show up again in their chronologically correct
   postion in time, but without the sticky indicator.
-  If you have a plugin or widget that lists popular posts or comments,
   make sure that this sticky post is not always at the top of those
   lists unless it really is popular.
